{"name":"the-pudding_decay-of-90s-pop-song-recognition","title":"Decay of 90s Pop Song Recognition","description":"Measuring how recognizable 90's pop songs are, based on the age of the listener when the song premiered\n\n---\n{\"editor\":\"simple\"}\n---\n## **About:**\nThese data were used to understand how recognizable pop music released in the 90s is to better understand how music knowledge is passed from generation to generation. Findings were presented in a visual essay on [The Pudding](https://pudding.cool) called [\"Defining the 90s Music Canon\"](https://pudding.cool/2020/07/song-decay/) in July 2020.\n\n## **Data Collection:**\nThese data were collected through crowd-sourcing, via a music challenge (available [here](https://pudding.cool/2020/04/music-challenge/)). Users were asked to share their birth year and then listen to a 30 second snippet of a song and then indicate how familiar they are with the song. Their choices were `don't know`, `sounds familiar`, `know it`, and `singing the lyrics`. By default, users are only asked to respond to 10 songs, but users can choose to continue to submit their responses for more songs.\n\nThese data reflect input from users submitted between April and July 2020.\n\nQuestions or comments, contact: [Matt Daniels](mailto:matt@pudding.cool)\n\n## **License:**\n[MIT
